            <div class="column pad">
                <p class="first">Elon Musk on Tuesday lashed out at President Donald Trump’s agenda bill — which the president is pressuring GOP senators to support — calling it a “disgusting abomination.” “I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination,” the tech billionaire posted on X. “Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.”</p>
                <p>He added in a subsequent post: “Congress is making America bankrupt.” In another, he said: “In November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people.” Several White House officials said they were caught off guard by the harsh remarks. While Musk’s sentiments on the bill were no secret to senior staff in the West Wing, they weren’t expecting him to take such a strong public stance, according to those officials, especially given conversations Musk has had with White House staff and GOP lawmakers. This is not the first time Musk has attacked the bill. In an interview after the package was passed by Republicans in the House, Musk said he was “disappointed” in the massive bill, adding that it would increase “the budget deficit, not just decreases it” and undermine “the work that the DOGE team is doing.” Asked about his most recent criticism during a press briefing Tuesday afternoon, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt responded that “the president already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill.”</p>
                <p>“It doesn’t change the president’s opinion — this is one big, beautiful bill and he is sticking to it,” she added. House Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday forcibly pushed back against Musk, arguing he is “terribly wrong” about the legislation. The GOP leader added to reporters that he and Musk had a “very friendly conversation” over the phone Monday, where Johnson “extolled all the virtues of the bill.” “Elon is missing it, OK? And it’s not personal. I know that the [electric vehicle] mandate’s very important to him,” Johnson said. He added: “But for him to come out and pan the whole bill is to me, just very disappointing, very surprising in light of the conversation I had with him yesterday.” Musk’s company Tesla has benefitted from federal tax credits that give consumers up to $7,500 off of certain EVs manufactured in the US, something that would go away if the GOP bill passes.

                <p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who is trying to pass the bill through his chamber before July 4, called the billionaire’s opposition a “difference of opinion” but added he plans to “proceed at full speed.” Musk, who was granted special government employee status to lead the Department of Government Efficiency, officially left the administration Friday. Minutes after Musk posted on X, Republican Sen. Rand Paul said he agrees with the billionaire, adding: “We can and must do better.” Paul has publicly opposed the legislation as it’s currently written, arguing it adds to much to the national debt.</p>

                <p>Friedrich Merz, the newly inaugurated German chancellor, will take a seat in the Oval Office on Thursday for his first in-person meeting with US President Donald Trump.</p>
                <p>The meeting comes as a series of high-stakes international issues once again come to the fore. Trump has issued another round of warnings to the European Union on tariffs; the war in Ukraine appears no closer to ending; and pressure is mounting on Israel over the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza.</p>
                <p>Since taking office, Merz has been on a tour of European capitals, meeting with France’s Emmanuel Macron, Britain’s Keir Starmer and Poland’s Donald Tusk – before they all appeared in Kyiv alongside Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky in a show of European unity.</p>
                <p>The one major omission has been a meeting with Trump. While there have been phone calls between the two, the handshake accompanied by the frantic clicks of camera shutters will mark the start of the new German-US relationship.</p>
                <p>Germany’s status as the economic powerhouse of Europe and Merz’s repositioning of the country as a leader in European security – which includes a commitment to beef up its military and fall in line with Trump’s demands for NATO members to increase defense spending – underscore the importance of a successful encounter.</p>
